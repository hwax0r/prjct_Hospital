* Now my plans are to make DataBase without sql/nosql databases. I will use txt files
* I'd like to make a gui to this project using QT or another framework
* Also i'd like to use web-server to remote view and editing of files to other employees. Though I would definitely have the necessity to change the auth system
* every file wust be encoded with encryption system
* every new employee must use the code given to them by administrator to register their account. It will make the system more secure 
* cmd-line interface must be more user-friendly
